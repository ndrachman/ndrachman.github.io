                <h2>Nanopore Ion Sources for Mass Spectrometry</h2>

                <h3>Background:</h3>
                <p>Mass spectrometry is a powerful analytical technique used to identify and quantify molecules in complex mixtures. It's crucial in fields like proteomics, where scientists study the structure and function of proteins. However, current mass spectrometry methods face limitations in sensitivity and efficiency, especially when dealing with very small samples or when trying to analyze individual molecules.</p>
                
                <p>The most common method for introducing biological molecules into a mass spectrometer is electrospray ionization (ESI). While revolutionary, ESI is inefficient - typically only about 1% of the sample makes it into the mass analyzer. This inefficiency limits our ability to study very small samples, such as the contents of a single cell.</p>
                
                <p>My research focuses on developing a novel ion source that could overcome these limitations, potentially enabling new frontiers in biological research, such as single-cell proteomics or even single-molecule protein sequencing.</p>

                <h3>Key Findings:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>We've developed a nanopore ion source - a tiny glass tube with an opening less than 100 nanometers wide - that can emit ions directly from a liquid sample into a vacuum.</li>
                    <li>This nanopore source achieves over 90% efficiency in transmitting ions to the detector, a dramatic improvement over ESI's typical 1% efficiency.</li>
                    <li>Our source can produce mass spectra of various biomolecules, including amino acids and small peptides, often without the need for additional desolvation steps.</li>
                    <li>We've found evidence that our source operates by a different mechanism than ESI, directly evaporating ions rather than creating charged droplets. This difference explains its higher efficiency and unique capabilities.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Potential Applications:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Single-cell proteomics: The high sensitivity of our ion source could allow scientists to analyze the protein content of individual cells, providing new insights into cell-to-cell variations in health and disease.</li>
                    <li>Protein sequencing: Our technology might pave the way for sequencing individual protein molecules, which could revolutionize our understanding of protein structure and function.</li>
                    <li>Improved pharmaceutical analysis: The high efficiency and sensitivity of our source could enhance drug discovery and quality control processes in the pharmaceutical industry.</li>
                    <li>Advancements in other fields: Our findings could have implications beyond biology, potentially improving technologies like electrospray propulsion for spacecraft and atom probe tomography for materials science.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This research represents a significant step forward in mass spectrometry technology. By dramatically improving the efficiency and sensitivity of ion sources, we're opening doors to new types of experiments and analyses that were previously impossible, with potential impacts across a wide range of scientific and industrial applications.</p>

                <h2>Microfluidic flow metrology</h2>
                <p>My research at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) focused on advancing microfluidic flow metrology, particularly in the challenging regime of nanoliter-per-minute flow rates. This work addresses a critical need in various fields, including high-performance liquid chromatography, drug perfusion, and lab-on-a-chip applications.</p>
                
                <h3>Key Findings:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Investigated the dynamic behavior and relaxation times of an optofluidic flow meter across a wide range of flow rates (1-500 nL/min) and laser powers.</li>
                    <li>Developed and validated a theoretical model explaining the interplay between photobleaching rate and fluorophore transit time through the optical interrogation region.</li>
                    <li>Discovered a novel scaling relationship that relates relaxation times at different flow rates and optical irradiances, allowing for more efficient calibration and extended measurement capabilities.</li>
                    <li>Demonstrated the flow meter's ability to make dynamic measurements with unprecedented accuracy at the nanoliter-per-minute scale, achieving relaxation times on the order of 100 ms for 1 nL/min flows.</li>
                    <li>This device can measure flows down to 1 nL/min with less than 5% uncertainty, a significant improvement over existing methods.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Potential Applications:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Real-time monitoring of flow fluctuations in critical microfluidic applications.</li>
                    <li>Improved accuracy in drug delivery systems and infusion therapies, particularly important for neonatal care.</li>
                    <li>Enhanced performance in high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) systems, allowing for better control of short pump cycles.</li>
                    <li>More precise flow control in nanoelectrospray ionization (nanoESI) systems, potentially improving mass spectrometry results.</li>
                    <li>Advancement of lab-on-a-chip technologies requiring precise control of ultra-low flow rates.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>This research represents a significant step forward in ultra-low flow metrology, offering new possibilities for precise control and measurement in microfluidic systems. The improved understanding of the flow meter's dynamics and the novel scaling relationships developed in this work pave the way for more accurate and responsive microfluidic devices in various scientific and industrial applications.</p>
