                <p>I'm excited to announce the publication of our new paper on the optofluidic flow meter we developed at NIST that achieves unprecedented accuracy and dynamic measurement capabilities for extremely low fluid flows - down to just 1 nanoliter per minute. Our work addresses a critical need in the growing field of microfluidics. As these systems become more sophisticated and widely used in medical diagnostics, manufacturing, and research, the ability to precisely measure and control tiny amounts of fluid becomes increasingly important.</p>

                <p>In this work, we used our recently developed optofluidic flow meter to study the performance of commercial syringe pumps and thermal flow meters in the sub-microliter-per-minute regime. The optofluidic flow meter measures how quickly fluorescent molecules photobleach when exposed to laser light as they flow through a microchannel. By comparing measurements across different instruments, we demonstrated that our system provides superior accuracy and dynamic measurement capabilities. Notably, we found that many commercial pumps exhibit larger flow variations than their specifications suggest - information that was previously difficult to obtain at these scales.</p>

                <p>The reception to this work has been really great! I presented the work earlier this year at the annual ASMS conference, my first time presenting it to mass spectrometry experts, and was really pleased by the amount of positive feedback. Brown University recently put out a <a href="https://www.brown.edu/news/2024-09-09/mass-spectrometry">press release</a> to announce the publication, which has been picked up by a number of news outlets like <a href="https://theanalyticalscientist.com/techniques-tools/cleaning-up-the-mass-spec-source">The Analytical Scientist</a>, <a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-09-mass-spectrometry-technology-tiny-sample.html">Phys.org</a>, <a href="https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/nanopore-ion-source-overcomes-a-longstanding-logjam-in-protein-science-390767">Technology Networks</a>, <a href="https://www.azolifesciences.com/news/20240911/Revolutionizing-Protein-Analysis-with-Enhanced-Mass-Spectrometry.aspx">AZO Life Sciences</a>, and a few others.
